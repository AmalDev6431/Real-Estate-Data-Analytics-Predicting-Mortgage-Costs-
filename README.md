# Real-Estate-Data-Analytics-Predicting-Mortgage-Costs-
# Project Overview:
# A banking institution seeks insights into mortgage-backed securities, real estate, and geographic business investment. The goal is to predict monthly mortgage expenses for different U.S. regions, create a dashboard for analysis, and generate actionable insights.

# Week 1: Data Preparation and EDA:
* Import data, identify primary key, and handle missing values.
* Analyze debt and visualize high-second-mortgage locations.
* Calculate bad debt and explore debt distribution.
* Analyze population density and age demographics.
* Evaluate rent as a percentage of income.
* Conduct correlation analysis.
# Week 2: Data Pre-processing and Modeling:

* Perform factor analysis to identify latent variables.
* Build a linear regression model to predict monthly mortgage expenses.
* Focus on significant predictors and ensure model accuracy.
* Check for multicollinearity and normal distribution.
# Data Reporting:

* Create a Tableau dashboard with relevant charts and metrics.
* Visualize key data points, including rent distribution and population demographics.
